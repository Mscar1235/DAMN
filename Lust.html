            I need some water<br />
            Something came over me<br />
            Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat<br />
            Too close to comfort<br />
            As blood rush my favorite vein<br />
            Heartbeat racing like a junkie's<br />
            I just need you to want me<br />
            Am I asking too much?<br />
            Let me put the head in<br />
            Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat<br />
            I promise, just a touch<br />
            Let me put the head in<br />
            If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"<br />
            <br />

            Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now<br />
            I need everybody's motherfuckin'—<br />
            Door and his Nike Air Rattles<br />
            Rush the fire exit, no time for battles<br />
            Well I, I never expected<br />
            This that new shit<br />
            This that new, new shit<br />
            <br />

            Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up<br />
            Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up<br />
            Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch<br />
            Don't go to work today, cop you a fit<br />
            Or maybe some kicks and make you—<br />

            Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama<br />
            Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window<br />
            Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden<br />
            Go to the club or your mama house<br />
            Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)<br />
            Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up<br />
            Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up<br />
            Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
            Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent<br />
            Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you<br />
            Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you<br />
            Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce<br />
            It's whatever, just make it count<br />

            I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night<br />
            Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life<br />
            Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30<br />
            Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early<br />
            Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change<br />
            Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain<br />
            Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M<br />
            Take me a nap then do it again<br />
            We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news<br />
            Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true<br />
            All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep<br />
            None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap<br />
            Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—<br />
            Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly<br />
            Time passing, things change<br />
            Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways<br />
            Lust<br />



            Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame<br />
            Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame<br />
            Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)<br />
            Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)<br />
            Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)<br />
            Lately, in James 4:4 says<br />
            "Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord"<br />
            Brace yourself: Lust is all yours<br />

            I need some water<br />
