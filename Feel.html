            I feel like a chip on my shoulders<br />
            I feel like I'm losin' my focus<br />
            I feel like I'm losin' my patience<br />
            I feel like my thoughts in the basement<br />
            Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated<br />
            Feel like I don't wanna be bothered<br />
            I feel like you may be the problem<br />
            I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world<br />
            The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'<br />
            And fuck you if you get offended<br />
            I feel like friends been overrated<br />
            I feel like the family been fakin'<br />
            I feel like the feelings are changin'<br />
            Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded<br />
            Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it<br />
            Feel like I ain't feelin' you all<br />
            Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved<br />
            I feel for you, I've been in the field for you<br />
            It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—<br />

            I feel niggas been out of pocket<br />
            I feel niggas tappin' they pockets<br />
            I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it<br />
            I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants<br />
            I feel like all of y'all is desperate<br />
            I feel like all it take is a second to feel like<br />
            Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic<br />
            I ain't feelin' your presence<br />
            Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson<br />
            Feel like only me and the music though<br />
            I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual<br />
            I feel like the enemy you should know<br />
            Feel like the feelin' of no hope<br />
            The feelin' of bad dope<br />
            A quarter ounce manipulated from soap<br />
            The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom<br />
            I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison<br />
            I feel like it's just me<br />
            Look, I feel like I can't breathe<br />
            Look, I feel like I can't sleep<br />
            Look, I feel heartless, often off this<br />
            Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with<br />
            Darkest hours, lost it<br />
            Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'<br />
            Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins<br />
            Fill up the banks with dollars<br />
            Fill up the graves with fathers<br />
            Fill up the babies with bullshit<br />
            Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip<br />
            I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was<br />
            The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'<br />
            But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper<br />
            The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons<br />
            Monsters, false prophets schemin'<br />
            Sponsors, industry promises<br />
            Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton<br />
            Church, religion, token blacks in bondage<br />
            Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert<br />
            Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters<br />
            I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us<br />
            I can feel it, the dream is more than process<br />
            I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness<br />
            I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic<br />
            I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'<br />
            I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em<br />
            Maybe it's too late for 'em<br />
            I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em<br />
            But who the fuck prayin' for me?<br />
            <br />
            Ain't nobody prayin' for me<br />
            Who prayin' for me?<br />
            Ain't nobody prayin'<br />
