            Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101<br />
            Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds<br />
            He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk<br />
            Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done<br />
            He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me<br />
            I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."<br />
            He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer<br />
            To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him<br />
            "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:<br />
            If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."<br />
            Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of<br />
            All the memories collected, moments you could never touch<br />
            I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block<br />
            I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got<br />
            I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap<br />
            Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"<br />
            Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward<br />
            I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours<br />
            It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour<br />
            Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial<br />
            Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman<br />
            Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother<br />
            You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap<br />
            Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—<br />
            <br />
            Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control<br />

            It's not a place<br />

            You close your eyes to look around<br />

            Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph<br />
            The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives<br />
            Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters<br />
            Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us<br />
            It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street<br />
            Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with<br />
            Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office<br />
            We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again<br />
            But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?<br />
            Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood<br />
            Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?<br />
            I'll aks again—oops, accident<br />
            It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up<br />
            You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us<br />
            Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera<br />
            America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does<br />
