            Poverty's paradise<br />
            I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth<br />
            (I've been hungry all my life)<br />

            <br />
            What's up, family?<br />
            Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man<br />
            I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately<br />
            And I know you feel like, you know<br />
            People ain't been prayin' for you<br />
            But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart"<br />
            See, family, that's why you feel like you feel<br />
            Like you got a chip on your shoulder<br />
            Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...<br />
            <br />

            Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?<br />
            Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle<br />
            Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?<br />
            Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet<br />
            Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?<br />
            Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?<br />
            I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth<br />

            I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back<br />
            I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?<br />
            You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken<br />
            I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch<br />
            I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house<br />
            With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice<br />
            Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga<br />
            That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass<br />
            Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class<br />
            That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all<br />
            That TV better not be loud if you got it on<br />
            Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em<br />
            Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter<br />
            Better not hear you got caught up<br />
            I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father<br />
            I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin<br />
            I got buku payments to make<br />
            County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away<br />
            I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here<br />
            I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here<br />
            Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?<br />
            Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else<br />

            If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up<br />
            And then I'd take two puffs<br />
            I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)<br />
            I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)<br />
            Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now<br />
            (Pull them panties to the side now)<br />
            I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth<br />

            <br />

            I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises<br />
            I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house<br />
            I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out<br />
            I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'<br />
            I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches<br />
            I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused<br />
            I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool<br />
            Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra<br />
            Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate<br />
            I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges<br />
            Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'<br />
            Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax<br />
            Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast<br />
            I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments<br />
            I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'<br />
            I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17<br />
            All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things<br />

            If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up<br />
            And then I'd take two puffs<br />
            (I've been hungry all my life)<br />
            I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)<br />
            I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)<br />
            Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now<br />
            (Pull them panties to the side now)<br />
            Now<br />

            When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear<br />
            Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years<br />
            My newfound life made all of me magnified<br />
            How many accolades do I need to block denial?<br />
            The shock value of my success put bolts in me<br />
            All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?<br />
            Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?<br />
            Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?<br />
            At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all<br />
            Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall<br />
            Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'<br />
            30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus<br />
            What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks<br />
            Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?<br />
            I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered<br />
            How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?<br />
            The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'<br />
            Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'<br />
            I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck<br />
            At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged<br />
            How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city<br />
            What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me<br />
            What they see from me would trickle down generations in time<br />
            What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines<br />


            I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity<br />
            I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me<br />
            I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride<br />
            'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God<br />
            I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone<br />
            I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more<br />
            I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness<br />
            Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive<br />
            Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br />
            And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse<br />
            Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br />
            Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back<br />
            Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br />
            And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse<br />
            Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax<br />
            Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap<br />
            Damn<br />


            God damn you, God damn me<br />
            God damn us, God damn we<br />
            God damn us all<br />
            <br />

            You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"<br />
            So until we come back to these commandments<br />
            Until you come back to these commandments<br />
            We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse<br />
            Because He said He's gonna punish us<br />
            The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians<br />
            Are the true children of Israel<br />
            We are the Israelites, according to the Bible<br />
            The children of Israel<br />
            He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience<br />
            Because we chose to follow other gods<br />
            That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee<br />
            So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you<br />
            Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised<br />
            That's why we're in the position that we're in<br />
            Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments<br />
            And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us<br />
            We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live<br />
            Here, in today, in the United States of America<br />
            I love you, family, and I pray for you<br />
            God bless you<br />
            Shalom
