            It was always me versus the world<br />
            Until I found it's me versus me<br />
            Why, why, why, why?<br />
            Why, why, why, why?<br />
            Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!<br />
            We gon' put it in reverse<br />
            <br />

            Darling, I told you many times<br />
            And I am telling you once again<br />
            Just to remind you, sweetheart<br />
            That my—<br />

            <br />
            Oh, Lamar<br />
            Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard<br />
            Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark<br />
            Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star<br />
            Life is one funny ma'fucker<br />
            A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him<br />
            I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep<br />
            Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep<br />
            See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects<br />
            The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect<br />
            Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot<br />
            Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals<br />
            Anthony was the oldest of seven<br />
            Well-respected, calm and collected<br />
            Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack<br />
            A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her<br />
            His family history: pimpin' and bangin'<br />
            He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'<br />
            Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces<br />
            Even got some head from a smoker last weekend<br />
            Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie<br />
            Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him<br />
            Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily<br />
            Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies<br />
            Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case<br />
            Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it<br />
            That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin<br />
            He beat the case and went back to hustlin'<br />
            Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang<br />
            The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots<br />
            And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks<br />
            Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it<br />
            He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken<br />
            See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot<br />
            With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window<br />
            His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes<br />
            Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome<br />
            Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars<br />
            They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college<br />
            Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it<br />
            Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends<br />
            Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket<br />
            'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it<br />
            Stuck up the place before, back in '84<br />
            That's when affiliation was really at gears of war<br />
            So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime<br />
            Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's<br />
            Ducky was well-aware<br />
            They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year<br />
            He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides<br />
            Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits<br />
            Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him<br />
            In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention<br />
            That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time<br />
            Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why<br />
            You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments<br />
            Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it<br />
            Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again<br />
            Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits<br />
            Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident<br />
            Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?<br />
            Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life<br />
            While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight<br />
            <br />
