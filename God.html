            This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah<br />
            Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah<br />
            Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah<br />
            You feel some type of way, then a-ha!<br />
            Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)<br />


            Ever since a young man (Since a young man)<br />
            All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)<br />
            Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man<br />
            Y'all gotta see that I won, man<br />
            Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT<br />
            Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT<br />
            I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT<br />
            I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT<br />
            Look, look… hol' up!<br />
            Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap<br />
            Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats<br />
            Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack<br />
            Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak<br />
            Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak<br />
            Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—<br />

            Fuck is you talkin' to?<br />
            Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?<br />
            Slide on you like fallen drapes<br />
            God toss full of carnivals<br />
            I kill 'em with kindness<br />
            Or I kill 'em with diamonds<br />
            Or I put up like fifteen hundred<br />
            Get yo' ass killed by the finest<br />
            Everything in life is a gamble<br />
            Nothin' in life I can't handle<br />
            Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more<br />
            For the cause, I done put blood on sword<br />
            Everything I do is to embrace y'all<br />
            Everything I write is a damn eight ball<br />
            Everything I touch is a damn gold mine<br />
            Everything I say is from an angel<br />
            <br />
            I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit<br />
            Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift<br />
            I'm on, I ain't sorry for it<br />
            Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it<br />
            I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it<br />
            I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it<br />
            I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters<br />
            Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous<br />

            <br />

            This what God feel like<br />

            (This what God feel like)<br />
            Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)<br />
            Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"<br />

            Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)<br />
            You feel some type of way, then a-ha!<br />
