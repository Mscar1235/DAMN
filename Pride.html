            Love's gonna get you killed<br />
            But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me<br />
            And you and you and you and me<br />
            And you and you and you and me<br />
            And you and you and you and me and—<br />

            <br />
            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            In another life, I surely was there<br />
            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            I care, I care<br />


            Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions<br />
            Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?<br />
            The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em<br />
            Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?<br />
            See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world<br />
            I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world<br />
            I don't love people enough to put my faith in man<br />
            I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band<br />
            I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around<br />
            This time I might put you down<br />
            Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now<br />
            My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb<br />
            I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from<br />
            Pity parties and functions of you and yours<br />
            A perfect world, you probably live another 24<br />
            I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure<br />
            I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure<br />


            <br />


            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            In another life, I surely was there<br />
            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            I care, I care<br />
            <br />

            Maybe I wasn’t there (We saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there<br />


            Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive<br />
            Cold as December but never remember what winter did<br />
            I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid<br />
            Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays<br />
            Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there<br />
            Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here<br />
            I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back<br />
            The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that<br />
            Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride<br />
            A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies<br />
            Promises are broken and more resentment come alive<br />
            Race barriers make inferior of you and I<br />
            See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches<br />
            I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison<br />
            I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service<br />
            Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world<br />

            <br />

            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            In another life, I surely was there<br />
            Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />
            I care, I care<br />

            Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)<br />
            Maybe I wasn't there
